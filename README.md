# webjam-react-template

This is the template repository for ICSSC's WebJam 2024 _Introduction to Web APIs_ workshop.

## Developing with StackBlitz
After you've used this template to create a copy in your account, sign in to StackBlitz with your GitHub account.

Once you've successfully created a StackBlitz account, import your repository by clicking the "Open GitHub repository (BETA)" card. Type in your GitHub username, followed by a forward slash, followed by the name of the repository you created; or, if you see it in the dropdown, you can select it from there. Then, click "Open repository".

You should be greeted with an editor interface similar to Visual Studio Code, if you've used it before. The development server will take a while to start, but once it does you should see the Favorite Courses "app" on the right-hand side of your screen.

## About the Tech Stack
This template uses several technologies that you can consider incorporating into your WebJam project.

**TypeScript** is an extension of JavaScript that adds type annotations. 

**React** is a library for building JavaScript/TypeScript frontends. While its popularity has declined somewhat in recent years, it is still widely considered the industry standard, and remains in use by many applications and companies.

**Vite** is a bundler. It functions similarly to a compiler in that it takes in source files and outputs files that can then be used to display a page by your browser. It also enables fast local development.

**Biome** is a tool for reformatting and fixing issues in your TypeScript/React code.
